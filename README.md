## Installation

To get started with [Flarez Chat](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/flarezchat), follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, you can refer to the Flutter [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) for instructions on how to set it up.

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine if it is not already installed. You can download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the [Flarez Chat](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/flarezchat) repository.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

1. Clone the repository:


                    git clone https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/flarez-chat.git

This will create a local copy of the Flarez Chat project on your machine.


2. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

                    cd flarez-chat

3. Before running the app, make sure to install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

                    flutter pub get

If you encounter an error related to pub get, you can try running the following command to update outdated packages:

                   flutter pub outdated

This command will show you a list of outdated packages. You can then use the flutter pub upgrade command to upgrade the packages to their latest versions:

4. Run the app:

                   flutter run
Please note that these instructions assume you have Flutter and Git already set up on your machine. If you encounter any [issues](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/flarezchat/issues/new) or have any further questions, feel free to ask.
